Oasis Infobyte Web Development Internship
This repository contains the projects I completed during my web development internship at Oasis Infobyte. The internship provided me with valuable hands-on experience in developing web applications and sharpened my skills in front-end development.

Projects Completed
During the internship, I successfully completed the following tasks:

1. Professional Landing Page
In this task, I designed and developed a professional landing page for a fictional company. The landing page showcased the company's services, featured sections, and provided a clear call-to-action for visitors. I utilized HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to create an interactive and visually appealing landing page.

2. Portfolio Website
For the portfolio website task, I created a personal portfolio website to showcase my skills, projects, and achievements. The website featured a responsive design, allowing visitors to easily navigate and view my work on different devices. I utilized frameworks such as Bootstrap and used HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to implement various interactive elements.

3. Temperature Conversion Website
In the temperature conversion website task, I developed a simple web application that allowed users to convert temperatures between different units, such as Celsius, Fahrenheit, and Kelvin. The website provided an intuitive user interface where users could input a value and select the desired conversion units. I implemented the temperature conversion logic using JavaScript and ensured the website had a clean and user-friendly design.
