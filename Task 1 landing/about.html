        Hi, my name is Shashank Agrawal. I am a programmer with skills in HTML, CSS, and Python. I have a strong foundation in web development and programming, and I am passionate about creating interactive and visually appealing web applications.

        With HTML, I can create the structure of web pages by defining various elements such as headings, paragraphs, lists, and links. With CSS, I can style these elements by setting attributes such as font, color, size, and layout. Additionally, with Python, I can write code for web development, data analysis, machine learning, and scientific computing.
        
        I am excited to continue learning and improving my skills in these areas, and I look forward to applying them to real-world projects.</p></h2>
